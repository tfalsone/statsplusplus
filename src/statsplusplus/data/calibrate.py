calibrate.py — Derive league-specific valuation tables from actual data.

Produces config/model_weights.json with:
  - OVR_TO_WAR: position-specific Ovr→WAR regression (slope + intercept)
  - FV_TO_PEAK_WAR: derived from OVR_TO_WAR by mapping FV→expected peak Ovr
  - ARB_PCT: arb salary as fraction of market value by arb year
  - SCARCITY_MULT: FA availability by Pot grade (mid-season only)

Falls back to constants.py defaults when insufficient data.
