"""League-wide FV and surplus calculation pipeline.

Prospects (non-MLB, age ≤ 24): FV → prospect_fv table
MLB players: surplus value → player_surplus table

This module orchestrates the batch evaluation of all players in a league.
It reads ratings from the DB, calls the evaluation functions from the package,
and writes results back.

Usage:
    python3 -m statsplusplus.data.fv_calc
