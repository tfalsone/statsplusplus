## Scripts

| Script | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `refresh.py` | 280 | Pulls data from StatsPlus API into DB (all teams). |
| `fv_calc.py` | 142 | Computes FV for all prospects + surplus for all MLB players. Uses composite_score/ceiling_score when available, falls back to OVR/POT. ~8s runtime. |
| `evaluation_engine.py` | ~2350 | Custom player evaluation — computes Composite_Score, Ceiling_Score, Tool_Only_Score from tool ratings. Non-linear piecewise tool transform, WAR-derived recombination shares, asymmetric pitcher stat blend, SP innings-volume adjustment. Component-level scores (offensive_grade, baserunning_value, defensive_value, durability_score) and component ceilings. Component-level regression for weight derivation. Two-way player handling. Age-weighted ceiling blend, POT soft cap. Pure functions + batch pipeline. |
| `farm_analysis.py` | 691 | Angels farm scaffold — ranked prospects, grade tables, FV history, dev signals. |
| `roster_analysis.py` | 515 | Angels MLB roster scaffold — player cards, stat lines, contract info, surplus. |
| `prospect_query.py` | 220 | League-wide prospect rankings and farm system comparisons. |
| `contract_value.py` | 344 | MLB contract surplus/deficit with year-by-year projection. CLI + library. |
| `prospect_value.py` | 290 | Prospect trade surplus with option value model + career outcome probabilities. CLI + library. |
| `trade_calculator.py` | 200 | Trade package evaluation — surplus balance with sensitivity ranges. Accepts player names or IDs via `--offer`/`--receive`. Team-agnostic. |
| `trade_targets.py` | 350 | Trade target finder — MLB players by position with contract status (RENTAL/ARB/RENTAL+EXT/OPTION/CONTROLLED), seller classification, split ratings, pro-rated salary. |
| `trade_assets.py` | 150 | Tradeable assets for any team — MLB surplus players + farm prospects ranked by value. |
| `team_needs.py` | 160 | Positional needs vs league average — OPS/ERA gaps flagged by severity, upgrade priority list, platoon flags, `--aaa-roster` for full AAA depth. Works for any team. |
| `standings.py` | 115 | League-wide standings — W/L, run differential, pythagorean expected record. `--actual` flag shows actual W-L from `games` table with delta. `actual_record(team_id, year)` importable. |
| `free_agents.py` | 105 | Upcoming free agent class — expiring contracts with FA/ARB/TO status. ARB-eligible players (service time < 6 years) distinguished from true walk-year FAs. |
| `player_utils.py` | 324 | Shared evaluation logic — bucketing, FV calc, WAR/aging curves, normalization. |
| `league_config.py` | 120 | Single abstraction for league-specific settings. Loads from `league_settings.json` + `state.json`. |

## Key Design Decisions

**Two-tier ratings storage** — `ratings` table keeps only the latest snapshot (all teams overwritten
via `INSERT OR REPLACE`). `ratings_history` stores monthly in-game snapshots with slim columns
for development tracking. Demographics (height/bats/throws) are backfilled on existing rows via UPDATE.

**`contract_team_id` is unreliable for org membership** — The StatsPlus API retains the original
signing team's ID in `contract_team_id` even after Rule 5 drafts or other transfers. All contract
queries in `team_queries.py` use `_CONTRACT_ORG_SQL` + `_contract_org_params()` to additionally
filter by `players.team_id` / `parent_team_id`, ensuring only players currently in the org appear.

**Multi-stint stat aggregation** — `batting_stats` and `pitching_stats` store one row per team per
year (PK includes `team_id`). `player_queries.py` aggregates stints into one combined row per year
for display, preserving per-team breakdown as a `stints` list. Rate stats (ERA, OPS, K%, etc.) are
recomputed from summed counting stats — `_bat_row`/`_pit_row` store raw counts (`_d`, `_t`, `_er`,
`_hra`, `_bf`, etc.) alongside computed rates for this purpose. Percentile queries use `GROUP BY
player_id` with `SUM` to aggregate stints before computing rankings.

**FV calculation** — `calc_fv()` in `player_utils.py`. Inputs: Ovr, Pot, age vs. level norm,
bucket, work ethic, scouting accuracy. Key rules:
- RP FV hard cap at 50 (≤2.0 WAR/season ceiling); RP Pot scaled to 80% before FV calc (positional discount — only elite RPs reach FV 50). Surplus uses raw FV to avoid double-counting with RP WAR table.
- `Acc=L` applies -2 FV penalty + bust-only risk shift
- Critical tool penalties: Pot Control ≤35 or Pot Movement ≤35 (pitchers), Pot Contact ≤35 (hitters)
- Pitcher arsenal ceiling override: 3+ pitches Pot ≥80 → effective Pot ≥55
- Positional versatility bonus: +1/+2 FV for multi-position viability
- Unified defensive bonus: composite-driven base + weighted score modifier for all defensive positions (C/SS/CF/2B/3B/COF). Comp ≥ 70 + wt ≥ 65 → +3, comp ≥ 70 + wt 55-64 → +2, comp ≥ 70 + wt < 55 → +1, comp 60-69 + wt ≥ 65 → +2, comp 60-69 + wt 55-64 → +1. Position-weighted scores use position-specific tool importance.
- Platoon split penalty: -2/-3 FV for severe L/R splits (weak-side Contact < 30 for hitters, Stuff < 30 for pitchers)
- Knuckleball pitchers (`PotKnbl ≥ 45`) bucketed as SP regardless of supporting arsenal

**League-calibrated model** — `calibrate.py` derives valuation tables from the league's own data:

**StatsPlus API Ctrl bug** — The ratings CSV mislabels all three Ctrl columns. Data positions are correct (overall, vs_R, vs_L) but headers read `Ctrl_R`, `Ctrl_L`, `Ctrl_L` (duplicate). `_fix_ratings_header()` in `client.py` remaps: `Ctrl_R` → `Ctrl`, first `Ctrl_L` → `Ctrl_R`, second `Ctrl_L` stays. Applies to both 113-col and 126-col formats.

**League-calibrated model** — `calibrate.py` derives valuation tables from the league's own data:
- Position-specific `OVR_TO_WAR` regression (9 buckets: C, SS, 2B, 3B, CF, COF, 1B, SP, RP). All positions target mean WAR.
- `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR_BY_POS` for each hitter bucket (COF, SS, C, CF, 2B, 3B, 1B) — derived from OVR_TO_WAR via FV→peak Ovr mapping. COF produces less WAR per FV grade than SS or CF.
- `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR` (generic hitter average, fallback), `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR_SP`, `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR_RP`
- `ARB_PCT` from actual arb salary outcomes
- `SCARCITY_MULT` from mid-season FA availability by Pot (sigmoid mapping, monotonic)
- Stored in `config/model_weights.json`. `constants.py` loads calibrated values when present, falls back to hardcoded defaults. Runs automatically during refresh (before fv_calc).

**Contract surplus model** — `contract_value()` in `contract_value.py`:
- Pending contract extensions: checks `contract_extensions` table. If a pending extension exists, appends extension years and salary schedule after current contract ends instead of estimating arb control.
- MLB scarcity premium: positional multiplier on market value (`MLB_SCARCITY` in `constants.py`). SS +10%, CF/SP +6%, C/2B/3B +3%, COF/RP −6%, 1B −9%. Makes contract model consistent with prospect scarcity.
- `stat_peak_war` minimum: 1 qualifying season (was 2). Players with 1 season get stat-based projections instead of pure ratings fallback.
- Pitcher role-change fallback: when current role (SP/RP) has no qualifying seasons but the opposite role does, falls back to those stats scaled by IP ratio (SP→RP × 0.46, RP→SP × 2.15).
- Unproven player discount: when `stat_peak_war` is None (0 qualifying seasons), ratings-based WAR is discounted by 0.5×. Data showed low-Ovr players with no track record produce far below ratings projections.
- Pre-arb control estimation from games-based fractional service time. Uses role-adjusted denominators (hitters: g/162, SP: gs/32, RP: g/65) per year, summed across career. Pre-arb uses floor(svc); arb uses ceil(svc). Age gates: age ≥30 on min salary → veteran minor league deal.
- Arb salary projection: Ovr-based exponential model (MAE $0.53M/yr); RP-specific model calibrated from 35 arb contracts (566K × e^(0.0294 × Ovr), 25% annual raises)
- RP arb salary discount (0.80x)
- Non-tender gate: control truncated when projected arb salary exceeds 2× scarcity-adjusted market value
- Young player ratings blend: when ratings WAR > stat WAR and age < peak, blends the two (50% ratings at 21, fading to 0% at peak age). Upside-only — prevents undervaluing young players with limited track records.
- Development ramp: for young players with Pot > Ovr, projects Ovr growth toward Pot. Blends stat history (positive or negative) with ratings projection using 0.5^year decay. When no stat history, applies 0.5× discount to ratings projection.
- Veteran decline ratings blend: when stat WAR > ratings WAR and age > 31 (30 for pitchers), blends toward ratings. Weight = `age_w × gap_ratio` (capped 0.75). Prevents stale stat history from inflating projections for declining veterans.
- WAR floor at 0 (teams can release/DFA)
- Pre-arb age gate: age ≥28 on league minimum treated as 1yr FA deal

**Prospect surplus model** — `prospect_surplus_with_option()` in `prospect_value.py`:
- Probability-weighted surplus across base/mid/ceiling FV scenarios. Upside probabilities scale with youth (+5%/yr under 20) and Pot-FV gap (wider gap = more development runway, `gap_factor = min(1.0, (pot - fv) / 25)`).
- Position-specific `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR_BY_POS` for hitters (COF 3.0, SS 3.6, CF 3.9 at FV 50). Falls back to generic hitter average for unknown buckets.
- Age-adjusted development discount (bust probability only, not time value). Flattened curve: AAA 0.88, AA 0.78, A 0.68, Rookie 0.45, Intl 0.35. Age adjustment at 4%/yr vs level norm.
- Certainty multiplier from Ovr/Pot realization ratio, capped at 1.0 (no bonus for maxed prospects — proximity already rewarded by dev discount and time value).
- Realization blend: when Ovr/Pot > 0.7, blends FV-based peak WAR with Ovr-based current WAR (squared weight curve). Maxed players use OVR→WAR; developing players use FV→WAR. Downward-only.
- Scarcity multiplier by Pot (ceiling) — sigmoid-based mapping from FA availability rate. Calibrated from mid-season data: Pot 40 = 0.0 (12%+ FA rate), Pot 44 = 0.44 (3%), Pot 46 = 0.97 (<1%), Pot 50+ = 1.0 (0%). Monotonic, no single-point cliffs. Stored in `SCARCITY_MULT` (calibrated or default).
- SP-specific `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR_SP` table (1.5–4.9 WAR) — pitchers produce less WAR per FV grade than hitters
- RP-specific `FV_TO_PEAK_WAR_RP` table (0.7–1.9 WAR)
- Time-value discounting at 5%/yr
- Smooth market value ramp (linear from league min at 0 WAR to full $/WAR at 1.0 WAR)
- Prospect age cutoff: ≤24 (25yo minor leaguers excluded — MLB-bubble, not prospects)
- Zero surplus floor

**$/WAR** — $8.62M (2033). Calibrated from 70 multi-year MLB contracts (salary ≥$5M, years >1).
Stored in `config/league_averages.json`, recalculated each league refresh.

**IP storage** — the API returns `ip` as a truncated integer; `outs` is precise. All IP
values in the DB are stored as true decimal innings (`outs / 3`). ERA computed from outs
(`er * 27 / outs`). Display uses `fmt_ip` Jinja filter (33.333 → "33.1").

**SQLite WAL mode** — `db.py` enables WAL journal mode with 30s busy timeout. Allows
concurrent reads during writes so the web UI stays browsable during background refreshes.

**League configuration** — all league-specific settings (team IDs, divisions, mappings,
year, pyth exponent, ratings scale) live in `config/league_settings.json` and are accessed via
`league_config.config`. No hardcoded team IDs or league assumptions in scripts or web code.
`ratings_scale` (`"1-100"` or `"20-80"`) controls how `norm()` in `player_utils.py` handles
tool grades and how projection models interpret raw inputs.

**Summary reuse** — Both scaffold scripts support summary reuse from history files:
- `farm_analysis.py` reads `history/prospects.json` — dev signals (FV movement, stagnation, new season)
- `roster_analysis.py` reads `history/roster_notes.json` — Ovr movement ±5 and season-based refresh triggers

### Team Page Features

Tabbed layout (Main / Depth Chart / Organization / Hitters / Pitchers / Contracts / Finances / Player Development) with client-side JS tab switching. Page title (`<h1>`) shows full team name. Summary bar persists across all tabs.

- **Summary bar** — game date, MLB surplus, farm surplus, FV 50+ count, payroll, roster composition (SP/RP/Pos counts)
- **Main tab** — division standings (pythagorean W/L, viewed team highlighted, team names linked) and team batting/pitching stats side-by-side with league rank out of 34 (top-5 bright green, bottom-5 red). Record breakdown panel (Overall/Home/Away/vs Division/1-Run/L10/Streak). Recent games panel (last 10 with linked opponents and pitchers with running records).
- **Roster tab** — position players and pitchers sorted by WAR (Pos/Role first column), surplus leaders (MLB + farm combined, top 15 by surplus)
- **Contracts tab** — MLB contracts only (`is_major=1`) sorted by salary with surplus/option flags, upcoming free agents (multi-year deals expiring within 2 years, or age 30+ on 1-year deals — excludes pre-arb/arb players with team control)
- **Finances tab** — committed payroll table with 6-year horizon. Per-player salary by year with TO/PO option markers and NTC badges. Arb/pre-arb projections shown in italics with `est` superscript. Pre-arb summary row for min-salary players with no projected future. Total committed row in footer.

- All queries parameterized by `team_id` — any team's page viewable via `/team/<id>`

### Player Page Features

MLB players use a three-tab layout (Overview / Stats / Contract). Prospects display all content on a single page without tabs.

- **Ratings panel** — overlaid current/potential grade bars (20-80 scale, color-coded by tier). Sections: Hitting tools → Running (Speed/Steal) → Positions → Defense. Defense ordered by position type (infielders: Range/Error/Arm/Turn DP; outfielders: Range/Error/Arm; catchers: Blocking/Framing/Arm). Pitchers show GB% as raw percentage.
- **L/R split toggles** — on Ratings, Percentile Rankings, and Overview stats snapshot. Split percentile expected values use split-specific ratings (e.g. `cntct_l` for vs-L).
- **Stats tab split selector** — 3-button selector (Overall / vs L / vs R) on batting and pitching stats tables. Each view shows full year-by-year history for that split (2020-2033).
- **Stats snapshot** — compact current-year stats on Overview tab between scouting report and percentiles. Pitchers show pitching stats, hitters show batting stats. L/R toggle for current year.
- **Percentile rankings** — Baseball Savant style with fill bars, dots, blue-to-red gradient. Performance tags for rating-to-stat divergence (Hot/Cold/Lucky/Unlucky). Scaled threshold (25 at midrange, 15 at extremes). Unqualified players shown in grey with "(small sample)" label. Hitter BABIP expected uses regression model (cntct + speed, R²=0.23) plus historical residual adjustment from 2+ prior qualifying seasons. Pitcher BABIP expected uses pbabip regression model (BABIP = 0.439 - 0.0028 × pbabip). Pitcher qualification: SP 0.7 IP/team game, RP 0.35 IP/team game (RP detected by GS/G < 0.25).
- **Fielding percentiles** — per-position FPCT/ZR (all), +Arm (OF), +Framing (C). ZR expected from rating composites (IF: IFR/IFE, OF: OFR, C: IFR/CArm/CBlk). Framing expected from CFrm/CBlk. Qualifier: 1.0 IP per team game.
- **Fielding stats** — Year/Pos/G/IP/TC/A/E/DP/FPCT/ZR/Arm table.
- **Contract panel** — year-by-year salary with NTC badge on header, TO/PO badges on final year row.
- **Surplus projection** — year-by-year breakdown (MLB: WAR/market/salary/surplus; prospects: control years/ETA/dev discount). Pessimistic/optimistic range.
- **Stats tables** — Batting: Year/G/PA → slash/ISO → BB%/SO%/BABIP → HR/RBI/SB-CS → OPS+/WAR. Pitching: Year/G/GS/IP → ERA/ERA+/FIP/SIERA → K%/BB%/K-BB%/GB%/BABIP → W/L/SV/HLD → WAR.
- **Header** — Ovr/Pot color-coded by tier. StatsPlus external link. Prospects show FV; MLB players omit redundant Ovr display.
