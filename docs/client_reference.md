# StatsPlus Client Reference

Python API client at `statsplus/client.py`. Credentials resolved from league context
(`data/app_config.json` → `league_settings.json`) or explicit `configure()`.
All methods return parsed data (list of dicts, or dict) and raise on error.

Import: `from statsplus import client`

## Authentication

Two methods:

1. **Session cookie** — `sessionid=<value>;csrftoken=<value>` from browser. Used by our client.
2. **Team token** — `?token=XXXX` query parameter from the Preferences page on StatsPlus.
   Valid for one team in one league. Works without cookie for `/ratings` and `/tradeblock`.

Cookie stored in `data/app_config.json`. Expires periodically — refresh from browser if auth fails.

## Player Stats

All three stat methods share the same optional parameters:

| Param | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `year` | int | Season year. Defaults to current year (all years if `pid` also set). **Repeatable.** |
| `pid` | int | Single player ID. Omit for all players |
| `split` | int | 1=Overall, 2=vsL, 3=vsR, 21=Playoffs. Omit for all splits |
| `lid` | int | League ID filter. Defaults to primary top-level league. **Repeatable.** |

**Important:** The `lid` parameter enables **minor league stats**. Pass the appropriate
league ID to get stats for that level:

| Level | League IDs (eMLB) |
|---|---|
| MLB | 150 |
| AAA | 151, 152 |
| AA | 153, 154, 155 |
| A | 156, 157, 158, 159, 160 |
| Rookie | 165 |

League IDs are league-specific. Use `/lgdata` to discover the full hierarchy for any league.
Multiple `lid` params can be combined: `?lid=151&lid=152` returns both AAA leagues.

### `get_player_batting_stats(...) -> list[dict]`
Player batting stat lines. Each row is one player+year+split combination.

Key fields: `player_id`, `year`, `team_id`, `league_id`, `level_id`, `split_id`,
`ab`, `h`, `d`, `t`, `hr`, `r`, `rbi`, `sb`, `cs`, `bb`, `k`, `pa`, `pitches_seen`,
`g`, `gs`, `ibb`, `gdp`, `sh`, `sf`, `hp`, `ci`, `wpa`, `stint`, `ubr`, `war`

```python
# MLB stats (default behavior)
stats = client.get_player_batting_stats(year=2033, split=1)

# AAA stats
aaa_stats = client.get_player_batting_stats(year=2033, split=1, lid=151)

# Multiple minor leagues at once
milb_stats = client.get_player_batting_stats(year=2033, split=1, lid=151)  # per-lid call
```

### `get_player_pitching_stats(...) -> list[dict]`
Player pitching stat lines.

Key fields: `player_id`, `year`, `team_id`, `league_id`, `level_id`, `split_id`,
`outs`, `ab`, `tb`, `ha`, `k`, `bf`, `rs`, `bb`, `r`, `er`, `gb`, `fb`, `pi`,
`g`, `gs`, `w`, `l`, `s`, `sa`, `da`, `sh`, `sf`, `ta`, `hra`, `bk`, `ci`, `iw`, `wp`, `hp`,
`gf`, `dp`, `qs`, `svo`, `bs`, `ra`, `cg`, `sho`, `sb`, `cs`, `hld`, `ir`, `irs`,
`wpa`, `li`, `stint`, `sd`, `md`, `war`, `ra9war`

### `get_player_fielding_stats(...) -> list[dict]`
Player fielding stats by position. No splits — `split` param is ignored.
Supports `year`, `pid`, and `lid` parameters.

Key fields: `player_id`, `year`, `team_id`, `league_id`, `level_id`, `position`,
`tc`, `a`, `po`, `er`, `ip`, `g`, `gs`, `e`, `dp`, `tp`, `pb`, `sba`, `rto`, `ipf`, `plays`, `plays_bas`

**Note:** Minor league fielding returns data via `lid` parameter (confirmed working for AAA/AA).

---

## Team Stats

### `get_team_batting_stats(year: int = None, split: int = None) -> list[dict]`
Team batting stats for major league teams. Split values: 1=Overall, 2=vsL, 3=vsR.

### `get_team_pitching_stats(year: int = None, split: int = None) -> list[dict]`
Team pitching stats for major league teams.

```python
team_bat = client.get_team_batting_stats(year=2033, split=1)
angels_bat = next(r for r in team_bat if r.get("tid") == 44)
```

---

## Contracts

### `get_contracts() -> list[dict]`
All current active contracts across the league, including farm players.

**Currently stored fields:**
`player_id`, `team_id`, `contract_team_id`, `is_major`, `season_year`,
`salary0`–`salary14`, `years`, `current_year`, `no_trade`,

| `last_year_vesting_option` | Vesting option in final year |
| `next_last_year_team_option` | Team option in penultimate year |

| `minimum_pa` | PA threshold for incentive |
| `minimum_pa_bonus` | Bonus if PA threshold met |
| `minimum_ip` | IP threshold for incentive |
| `minimum_ip_bonus` | Bonus if IP threshold met |

### `get_contract_extensions() -> list[dict]`
Signed extensions that take effect in future seasons. Same schema as contracts. May be empty.

---

## Ratings

### `get_ratings(player_ids: list[int] = None, poll_url: str = None) -> list[dict]`
Ratings for all active players (scouted if league uses scouts, otherwise OSA). This endpoint
enforces a ~4 min rate limit between requests.

- `player_ids` — optional filter to specific player IDs (full job still runs, filtered client-side)
- `poll_url` — pass a previously returned poll URL to skip job startup

**OSA ratings:** Add `&osa=1` to the initial `/ratings` request to get OSA ratings instead
of scouted ratings. Not yet implemented in client.

The endpoint is async: the initial request returns a poll URL; the client polls until CSV is ready.
Export takes at least 30 seconds; client handles retries automatically (up to ~5 minutes).

**International complex players** have a negative `League` field (e.g. `-150`).

Key fields: `ID`, `Name`, `Team`, `Pos`, `Ovr`, `Pot`, plus per-attribute ratings.

Two known column formats:
- **113-column** — older OOTP versions
- **126-column** — adds BABIP, HRA, PBABIP splits + PotBABIP/PotHRA/PotPBABIP + Prone

Overall/Potential are stored as `(stars × 2)`, e.g. 3.5 stars = `7`.

The API has a known bug: mislabels Ctrl columns (Ctrl_R → Ctrl, first Ctrl_L → Ctrl_R).
Client's `_fix_ratings_header()` corrects this automatically.

### `start_ratings_export() -> str`
Kick off the ratings export and return the poll URL without waiting. Used by refresh to
overlap the export generation with other API calls.

## League Structure

### `/lgdata` ⚡ NEW — Not Yet Implemented

Returns a single JSON structure with complete league hierarchy and current standings.

**Top-level keys:** `leagues`, `subleagues`, `divisions`, `teams`, `standings`

```python
# Not yet wrapped in client.py
data = client._json("/lgdata/")
```

| Key | Fields |
|---|---|
| `leagues[]` | `league_id`, `name`, `abbr`, `level`, `state`, `parent_league_id`, `primary_league` |
| `subleagues[]` | `league_id`, `sub_league_id`, `name`, `abbr`, `designated_hitter` |
| `divisions[]` | `division_id`, `league_id`, `sub_league_id`, `name` |
| `teams[]` | `team_id`, `name`, `nickname`, `abbr`, `league_id`, `sub_league_id`, `division_id`, `parent_team_id`, `level` |
| `standings[]` | `team_id`, `g`, `w`, `l`, `t`, `pos`, `pct`, `gb`, `streak`, `magic_number` |

**League state values:** 0=Preseason, 1=Spring Training, 2=Regular Season, 3=Playoffs, 4=Offseason

**Key uses:**
- Replace our game-frequency clustering for division detection (authoritative source)
- Real W-L standings (vs pythagorean-only)
- Minor league structure discovery (league IDs for stats queries)
- DH rule detection per subleague

---

## Trade Block

### `/tradeblock` ⚡ NEW — Not Yet Implemented

Returns JSON list of all player IDs currently on the trade block in the league.

```python
# Not yet wrapped in client.py
data = client._json("/tradeblock/")
# {"player_ids": [20394, 25681, 28271, ...]}
```

Requires authentication (session cookie or team token).

**Key uses:**
- Flag confirmed-available targets in `trade_targets.py`
- Surface trade block players in trade workbench UI
- Reduce false positives in target identification

---

## Ballparks

### `/ballparks` ⚡ NEW — Not Yet Implemented

Returns JSON with OOTP park factors, capacity, stadium type, and surface for all ballparks.
Optional `?lid=N` parameter for specific league.

```python
# Not yet wrapped in client.py
data = client._json("/ballparks/")
```

Response structure:
```json
{
  "league_id": 0,
  "ballparks": [
    {
      "team_id": 44,
      "league_id": 150,
      "park_id": 25,

      "surface": "Grass"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key uses:**
- Park-adjusted projections and stat normalization
- Context for player evaluation (pitcher-friendly vs hitter-friendly)
- Display on team pages
