## DB Tables (league.db)

| Table | Owner | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `players` | `refresh.py` | All players across all orgs and levels |
| `teams` | `refresh.py` | Team ID → name, level, parent org, league |
| `ratings` | `refresh.py` | Scouting ratings (121 cols, latest snapshot only). Overall + L/R splits for batting and pitching tools, defensive grades, character traits, demographics. Extended ratings (BABIP, HRA, PBABIP, Prone) populated when the league's OOTP version provides them. PK: `(player_id, snapshot_date)`. |
| `ratings_history` | `refresh.py` | Monthly in-game rating snapshots (53 cols). Ovr/pot, hitter/pitcher tools (cur+pot), all 12 pitch types (cur+pot), extended ratings when available. PK: `(player_id, snapshot_date)`. |
| `contracts` | `refresh.py` | Active contracts league-wide (up to 15 salary years) |
| `contract_extensions` | `refresh.py` | Pending contract extensions signed during the season |
| `batting_stats` | `refresh.py` | MLB batting stats by player/year/split/team |
| `pitching_stats` | `refresh.py` | MLB pitching stats by player/year/split/team |
| `fielding_stats` | `refresh.py` | Player fielding stats by position (G, IP, TC, E, ZR, framing, arm) |
| `team_batting_stats` | `refresh.py` | Team-level batting aggregates by year/split |
| `team_pitching_stats` | `refresh.py` | Team-level pitching aggregates by year/split |
| `games` | `refresh.py` | Game results with scores, WP/LP/SV |
| `prospect_fv` | `fv_calc.py` | FV grades for all non-MLB prospects |
| `player_surplus` | `fv_calc.py` | Surplus value for all MLB players (includes `surplus_yr1` for current-season) |

| View | Description |
|---|---|
| `latest_ratings` | Most recent snapshot only — used by all web queries to avoid join multiplication |

## Key Conventions

- Each league's data lives in `data/<league>/league.db`. The web layer is read-only.
- `data/<league>/config/` contains JSON configuration and league-level aggregates.
- `data/<league>/history/` contains hand-written scouting summaries and FV tracking.
- `data/<league>/tmp/` contains intermediate scaffolds — script output that feeds report writing.
- `data/<league>/reports/` contains final published reports organized by game-year.
- `data/app_config.json` stores global config: `active_league` slug and `statsplus_cookie`.
- League context resolved via `scripts/league_context.py` (shared) and `web/web_league_context.py` (Flask request-scoped).
