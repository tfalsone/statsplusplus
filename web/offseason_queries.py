web/offseason_queries.py — data for the phase-aware Offseason page (Phase A).

This is a *view* over existing data and evaluation functions, organized around
the decisions a GM makes during the offseason. It intentionally reuses the
established query/eval machinery (arb model, upcoming-FA, payroll projection,
surplus) rather than introducing new models.

Panels (Phase A / proof-of-concept):
  - Arbitration    : arb-eligible own players, projected salary, tender rec
  - Free agency    : your expiring players (retain priority) + market board
  - Payroll outlook : next-year committed + projected vs current
  - Extensions     : high-surplus players 1-2 years from free agency

Phase B (Rule 5 / 40-man) is gated on storing the /players Rule-5 fields and is
not built here.

    - **this_offseason** : option year == game_year + 1 (the decision that

    - **upcoming**        : option year >= game_year + 2 (future offseasons).

      model — exercising costs the option salary, declining costs the buyout, so
      the breakeven is ``proj_value > option_salary - buyout``. Shown for
      upcoming options too, framed as advance planning.
    - **Player / vesting options**: informational (the team doesn't decide).

    The option year is derived from the contract (``season_year + offset``), NOT
    the game year — a last-year option resolves at ``season_year + years - 1``,
    a next-last-year option one year earlier.
