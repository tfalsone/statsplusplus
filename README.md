# Stats++

An assistant GM dashboard for [OOTP Baseball](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/) leagues managed through [StatsPlus](https://statsplus.net/). Pulls live league data from the StatsPlus API and presents it as an interactive local web dashboard with ratings, percentiles, prospect rankings, contract analysis, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A [StatsPlus](https://statsplus.net/) league with API access
- Your StatsPlus session cookie (see [Getting Your Cookie](#getting-your-statsplus-cookie) below)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> statsplusplus
cd statsplusplus
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The only dependency is Flask. Everything else uses the Python standard library.

> **Note for Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian users:** The system Python is externally managed (PEP 668) and `pip install` will be blocked without a virtual environment. The `python3 -m venv` step above handles this. If `python3 -m venv` fails, install the venv package first: `sudo apt install python3-full`.

### 2. Launch the web UI

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 web/app.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:5001`. You'll be redirected to the onboarding wizard on first visit.

### 3. Onboard a league

The wizard walks you through:

1. **Connect** — Paste your StatsPlus session cookie and league slug (e.g. `emlb`, `vmlb`)
2. **Configure** — Select your team, confirm league structure (divisions auto-detected)
3. **Refresh** — Pull all league data (rosters, stats, ratings, contracts). Takes 2-3 minutes.

Once complete, the dashboard is fully populated.

### 4. Add more leagues

Go to **Settings → Add League** and repeat the onboarding process. Switch between leagues via the dropdown in the nav bar.

## Data Flow

```
StatsPlus API → client.py → refresh.py → league.db (SQLite)
                                              ↓
                                     web/app.py (Flask)
                                              ↓
                                        Browser UI
```

`refresh.py` handles the full pipeline: fetches rosters, batting/pitching/fielding stats, ratings, contracts, and team stats for all teams in the league, then computes league averages and runs FV/surplus calculations. The web layer reads from SQLite only.

## Player Evaluation Model

Stats++ builds its own player evaluation independent of the game's OVR/POT ratings. This gives you a second opinion grounded in tool analysis and league-calibrated data.

### Composite Score (20-80 scale)

Every player gets a **composite score** — a tool-weighted assessment of their current ability. For hitters, this combines offensive tools (contact, gap, power, eye, K-rate), baserunning (speed, steal), and defense (position-specific weights). For pitchers, it combines stuff, movement, control, and arsenal depth/quality.

The composite is the same methodology for prospects and MLB players, providing a unified basis for comparison across the prospect/MLB threshold. MLB players additionally get a **stat-blended score** that incorporates recent performance (OPS+, ERA/FIP), shown alongside the pure tool score on player pages.

Tools below the MLB floor (35 on the 20-80 scale) receive an additional penalty — empirical analysis shows MLB hitters with a sub-35 tool underperform their OVR by ~0.3-0.5 WAR per season.

### FV Grade and Risk Label

Prospects receive an **FV grade** (Future Value) on the standard 20-80 scale in 5-point increments (40/45/50/55/60/65/70). FV answers: *how good could this player become if he develops?*

FV is computed as ceiling quality relative to the MLB positional median. A prospect whose ceiling projects as an above-average MLB starter at their position gets FV 50. The grade scales with how far above (or below) the positional median their ceiling sits, weighted by how much of that ceiling they've already realized.

A separate **risk label** (Low / Medium / High / Extreme) captures development probability. Risk is derived from the player's age, gap between current ability and ceiling, empirical gap closure rates for the league, and character traits (work ethic, intelligence). This separation means FV tells you the ceiling quality while risk tells you the likelihood of getting there.

### Surplus Value

Every player — prospect and MLB — has a **surplus value** in dollars. This is the difference between projected on-field value and salary cost over remaining team control. Surplus is the currency of trades: a fair trade has roughly equal surplus on both sides.

For prospects, surplus projects six years of team control using the FV grade, position-specific WAR tables, aging curves, and development discounts by level. For MLB players, surplus uses a blend of stat-based and ratings-based WAR projections against actual contract costs.

### League Calibration

All model parameters are derived from each league's own data during calibration:

- **Tool weights** — Per-position regression of tool ratings against WAR
- **WAR curves** — OVR-to-WAR and Composite-to-WAR tables per position
- **Development curves** — Gap closure rates, age runway, and expected gaps from cross-sectional OVR/POT analysis
- **Financial tables** — Arbitration percentages, scarcity multipliers, years-to-MLB by level

This means the model adapts to each league's settings (development speed, aging, financial structure) rather than using one-size-fits-all assumptions.

For full model details, see `docs/valuation_model.md`.

## CLI Tools

All scripts operate on the active league (set in `data/app_config.json` or via the web UI).

```bash
# Full league refresh
python3 scripts/refresh.py [year]

# Generate analysis scaffolds for your team
python3 scripts/roster_analysis.py
python3 scripts/farm_analysis.py

# League-wide queries
python3 scripts/prospect_query.py
python3 scripts/free_agents.py
python3 scripts/standings.py

# Trade evaluation
python3 scripts/trade_calculator.py --trade '<json>'
```

## Configuration

League data lives in `data/<league>/config/`:

- **`state.json`** — Current game date and year
- **`league_settings.json`** — Team names/abbreviations, role/position maps, division structure, minimum salary, DH rules
- **`league_averages.json`** — Computed batting/pitching averages and $/WAR

Global config in `data/app_config.json`:

- **`active_league`** — Which league slug is currently selected
- **`statsplus_cookie`** — Session cookie for API access

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLite
- **Frontend**: Server-rendered Jinja2 templates, vanilla JS, CSS custom properties (dark theme)
- **Data source**: StatsPlus REST API (CSV exports for ratings)
- **No external JS frameworks** — lightweight, fast, works offline after refresh

## Getting Your StatsPlus Cookie

The StatsPlus API requires authentication via session cookie. To get yours:

1. Log in to [statsplus.net](https://statsplus.net/) in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies → `statsplus.net`
3. Copy the values for `sessionid` and `csrftoken`
4. Format as: `sessionid=<value>;csrftoken=<value>`

Paste this into the onboarding wizard when prompted. The cookie is stored locally in `data/app_config.json` and never transmitted anywhere except to the StatsPlus API.

Cookies expire periodically — if refreshes start failing with authentication errors, grab a fresh cookie from your browser.

## Troubleshooting

**"No module named flask"** — Run `.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project root.

**Refresh fails or times out** — The StatsPlus API can be slow. Ratings exports in particular may take 45+ seconds. The refresh will retry automatically. If it consistently fails, check that your session cookie is still valid.

**Empty data after refresh** — Some StatsPlus leagues don't expose minor league stats via the API. MLB-level stats should always populate. Check the DB validation counts in the Settings page.

**Port already in use** — The default port is 5001. If it's taken, edit the `app.run()` call in `web/app.py`.
